### 🩵 Flutter Blue Ultra

An open-source, free to use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) plugin for Flutter.
Flutter Blue Ultra continues support and maintenance for the legacy 1.x API of `flutter_blue_plus`, while adding new capabilities and keeping pace with the evolution of the underlying native Bluetooth stacks.

### 🙂 Why Flutter Blue Ultra?
- **Legacy 1.x compatibility**: keep using the well-known `flutter_blue_plus` 1.x API surface.
- **Cross‑platform**: iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, and Web (central role).
- **New functionalities**: actively expands features while preserving the familiar API.
- **Tracks native evolution**: maintained to follow Android/iOS/macOS/Linux/Web Bluetooth API changes.

### ⚡ Quick start
1) Add the package in your app (temporary path or git until pub release):
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_blue_ultra:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/dotintent/flutter_blue_ultra.git
```

2) Minimal usage example:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_blue_plus/flutter_blue_plus.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure bluetooth supported and on before scanning
  if (await FlutterBluePlus.isSupported == false) return;
  await FlutterBluePlus.adapterState
      .where((s) => s == BluetoothAdapterState.on)
      .first;

  // Scan briefly
  await FlutterBluePlus.startScan(timeout: const Duration(seconds: 5));
  await FlutterBluePlus.isScanning
      .where((v) => v == false)
      .first;
}
```
